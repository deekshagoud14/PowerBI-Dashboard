1. Project Title / Headline
📊 Prism Insurance Analytics Dashboard
A complete, interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze insurance policies, claims, customer demographics, premium distribution, and operational performance. This visualization helps stakeholders track business KPIs, monitor claim trends, and make data-driven decisions.


2. Short Description / Purpose
The Prism Insurance Analytics Dashboard provides a unified view of critical insurance metrics across multiple categories including claim amounts, policy types, premium distribution, customer details, and claim statuses.
This dashboard supports business analysts, insurance managers, risk officers, and decision-makers to quickly understand business performance, identify trends, and evaluate operational efficiency.

3. Tech Stack
This dashboard was developed using the following tools & technologies:
📊 Power BI Desktop – Main data visualization and reporting tool
📂 Power Query – Data transformation, cleaning & preprocessing
🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Measures, KPIs, calculated fields
🧱 Data Modeling – Relationships between claims, customers, and policy tables
📁 File Formats – .pbix (dashboard), .png (report preview)

4. Data Source
Source: Sample Insurance Dataset (policies, claims, customers, premiums)
The dataset includes information such as:
. Policy details (type, status, coverage, premium)
. Claim data (claim amount, claim status, claim number)
. Customer demographics (age group, gender, ID)
. Insurance product categories (Life, Auto, Health, Travel, etc.)
The data is structured across multiple tables supporting cross-filtering and multi-dimensional analysis.

5. Features / Highlights
🧩 Business Problem
Insurance companies often struggle with:
. Understanding claim trends
. Identifying high-risk policy types
. Monitoring premium performance
. Analyzing customer segments
. Tracking rejected vs settled claims
Without a dashboard, answering questions like:
. Which policies generate the highest premiums?
. Which age groups submit the highest claims?
. What percentage of claims are rejected or settled?
 becomes time-consuming and error-prone.

🎯 Goal of the Dashboard
This dashboard aims to:
✔ Provide a consolidated view of insurance operations
✔ Help identify trends in claims and premiums
✔ Support strategic planning using customer and policy insights
✔ Offer dynamic filtering for claim number, customer ID, and policy details
✔ Improve decision-making for business users
